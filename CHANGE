# CheckCollisionRecs
CheckCollisionRecs is actually in raymario  src/shapes.c

# GetCollider
Just an array with objects, probably now: GetPhysicsBody() in new Physac

Collider.bounds is from type Rectangle

# SetRigidbodyVelocity
Maybe manipulate PhysicsBody.velocity directly

# ApplyPhysics

# Transform

Probably is PhysicsBody

```
typedef struct Transform {
    Vector2 position; -> position
    float rotation;   -> orient
    Vector2 scale; -> ???
} Transform;
```

And since its a pointer we need to use something like this:
```
PhysicsBody floor = CreatePhysicsBodyRectangle((Vector2){ screenWidth/2, screenHeight }, 500, 100, 10);
```

# Physics
used for settings

```
typedef struct Physics {
    bool enabled;
    bool debug;
    Vector2 gravity;
} Physics;
```

-> InitPhysics(void);
-> SetPhysicsGravity()

```
45     physicsSettings = (Physics){true, false, (Vector2){0, -0.98f}};
146     SetPhysics(physicsSettings);
```

Also:
When 'p' was pressed i set the physics settings to debug:`
```
#ifdef Debug
	// Debug mode switch button
	if (IsKeyPressed('P'))
	{
		physicsSettings.debug = !physicsSettings.debug;
		SetPhysics(physicsSettings);
	}
#endif
```

Now this is not needed but handled by `PHYSAC_DEBUG`.
